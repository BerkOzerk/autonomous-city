# Autonomy: Definitions and Foundations

## What Is Autonomy?
Autonomy is the capacity of a system to:
- self-regulate,
- manage resources,
- make decisions,
- and withstand crises,
without relying on external authority.

Autonomy ≠ isolation.
It is a state of **non-dependent relational existence**.

## Individual vs Collective Autonomy
Individuals cannot be fully autonomous due to:
- biological needs,
- emotional attachments,
- economic interdependencies.

Therefore, autonomy emerges at the **collective level**.

**Autonomy = individual freedom + community self-sufficiency.**
