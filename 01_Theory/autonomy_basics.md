# Autonomy: Definitions and Foundations

## What Is Autonomy?

Autonomy is the capacity of a system to:

- self-regulate,
- manage resources,
- make decisions,
- withstand crises,

without relying on external authority.

Autonomy ≠ isolation.  
It is a state of **non-dependent relational existence**.

## Individual vs Collective Autonomy

Individual humans are limited by:

- biological needs,
- emotional dependencies,
- economic relations,
- social attachments.

Therefore, autonomy emerges more strongly at the **collective level**.

> **Autonomy = individual freedom + community self-sufficiency.**
