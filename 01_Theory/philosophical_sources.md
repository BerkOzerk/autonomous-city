# Philosophical Sources for Autonomous Urban Theory

## Plato – The Republic

Virtuous order requires a just distribution of power.  
Concentrated authority risks corruption and the collapse of the common good.

---

## Aristotle – Politics

The polis must be:

- self-sufficient,
- appropriately scaled,
- structured to allow citizens to know and recognize each other.

Excessive size leads to loss of autonomy and political agency.

---

## Al-Farabi – The Virtuous City

Virtue must be embedded in the **structure** of the city, not left to individual goodwill.

- Institutions should cultivate ethical behavior.
- The city’s form and order should support human flourishing.

---

## Montesquieu – The Spirit of the Laws

Power must be balanced and divided:

- legislative,
- executive,
- judicial.

The separation of powers is a structural defense against autocracy and a precondition for autonomy.

---

## Jane Jacobs

Jacobs shows that:

- mixed-use neighborhoods,
- walkable streets,
- short blocks,
- diverse users and activities

produce urban resilience and bottom-up order.  
Her work underlines that **everyday urban structure** is central to social autonomy.

## Richard Sennett – Flesh and Stone

Sennett explores the relationship between the human body and the city:

- cities that fit bodily rhythms and movement patterns create freedom,
- over-controlled, sterile spaces produce passivity.

Embodied, open, and incomplete spaces are vital for living autonomy.

## Ebenezer Howard – Garden City Vision

Howard proposed:

- self-sufficient, human-scale cities,
- population caps (~32,000) for manageability,
- permanent agricultural greenbelts for local resource cycles,
- federations of small towns instead of one centralized metropolis.

The Garden City is an early prototype of **distributed, resource-sovereign, and socially resilient** urban autonomy.

## George Orwell – Animal Farm

Orwell’s allegory demonstrates how:

- revolutionary ideals can decay,
- internal elites can form,
- equality can transform into a new hierarchy.

It is a cautionary tale: even systems founded on freedom can drift toward internal autocracy if power is not structurally limited.
