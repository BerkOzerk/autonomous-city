# Modern Threats to Autonomy

## 1. Media and Social Media

Media systems can:

- impose behavioral norms,
- shape identities,
- normalize consumption and status hierarchies.

They create invisible pressure that undermines independent judgment.

---

## 2. Technological Comfort and Dependency

Automation and digital convenience can:

- weaken decision-making capacity,
- reduce practical skills,
- concentrate control in hidden infrastructure operators.

---

## 3. Hyper-Individualism

When individualism becomes isolation:

- community bonds erode,
- shared institutions weaken,
- collective autonomy collapses.

---

## 4. Consumer Culture

Desire-management becomes a soft form of control:

- aspiration is scripted by brands,
- life goals are replaced by lifestyle images,
- autonomy is traded for belonging to market-defined identities.

## 5. Core Insight

> **Technical autonomy fails if cultural autonomy is not safeguarded.**

Urban systems can be energetically self-sufficient yet culturally dependent on external narratives, algorithms, and consumption models.
