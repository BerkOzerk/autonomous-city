# Modern Threats to Autonomy

## 1. Media & Social Media
Imposes behavioral norms, aesthetic expectations, and identity templates.

## 2. Technology
Creates comfort-dependent loops → weakens decision-making.

## 3. Hyper-Individualism
Destroys community cohesion → autonomy collapses.

## 4. Consumer Culture
Desire-management becomes a soft form of control.

## Thesis Contribution
Technical autonomy fails if cultural autonomy is not safeguarded.
