# Autonomy vs Autocracy

## Distributed vs Concentrated Power

- **Autonomy** distributes power across roles, communities, and protocols.
- **Autocracy** concentrates power in individuals, institutions, or centralized structures.

## The Tension

Spinoza warns that power often emerges **from within** the community, justified as “useful” or “necessary”.

Orwell shows how such internal power can slowly normalize itself and become a new authority.

Safeguards are required to prevent:

- personality cults,
- emotional manipulation,
- accumulation of unchecked decision power.

Autonomy is preserved when:

- no actor holds irreversible control,
- roles are time-limited and recallable,
- governance remains transparent and participatory.
