# Autonomy vs Autocracy

## Distributed Power vs Concentrated Power
Autonomy distributes power across:
- roles,
- communities,
- protocols,
- spatial systems.

Autocracy concentrates power in:
- individuals,
- institutions,
- centralized structures.

## The Tension
Spinoza warns:
> Power often emerges from within the community itself.

Orwell warns:
> Internal power can normalize itself and become authoritarian.

Safeguards must prevent:
- personal cults,
- manipulation of emotions,
- accumulation of decision-making authority.
