# Scale, Density, and Manageability

## The Question of Scale

Autonomy is sensitive to scale:

- too small → not enough specialization or redundancy,
- too large → bureaucracy, alienation, and centralization pressure.

## Insights from Theory

- Aristotle: a city should be small enough for citizens to know each other.  
- Jacobs: neighborhoods should be dense and diverse but still legible.  
- Howard: population caps (~30–40K) for each Garden City.

## Working Hypothesis

Optimal autonomy tends to emerge in settlements between **approximately 10,000 and 100,000** inhabitants, organized into **smaller, interacting units** (neighborhoods, districts).

This is not a strict rule, but a **guiding scale** for design and governance.
