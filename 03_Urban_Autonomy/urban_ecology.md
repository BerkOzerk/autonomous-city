# Urban Ecology and Autonomy

An autonomous city is an ecological system:

- humans,
- non-human species,
- infrastructures,
- resources,
- information flows

interact in continuous cycles.

## Ecological Requirements

- reduced dependence on distant resources,
- protection and integration of green and blue networks,
- climate-responsive design,
- long-term soil and water stewardship.

Urban ecology is not an “add-on” but the **substrate** of autonomy.
