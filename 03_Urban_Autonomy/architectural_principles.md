# Architectural Principles for Autonomous Urban Systems

## Spatial Requirements
- human-scale blocks,
- mixed-use buildings,
- open-ended public spaces,
- self-sufficient structures.

## Behavioral Architecture
Spaces must:
- invite interaction,
- tolerate conflict,
- support collective rituals,
- adapt to change.
