# Architectural Principles for Autonomous Urban Systems

## Spatial Requirements

- human-scale buildings and blocks,
- mixed-use programs,
- permeable ground floors,
- balconies, stoops, and thresholds that invite contact.

---

## Behavioral Architecture

Architecture should:

- enable spontaneous encounters,
- tolerate productive conflict,
- support communal rituals and shared work,
- adapt over time to changing needs.

---

## Self-Sufficient Structures

Where possible, buildings should:

- generate part of their own energy,
- manage water intelligently,
- allow for flexible interior use,
- support both individual and collective functions.

Architecture operates as a **material interface** for autonomy.
