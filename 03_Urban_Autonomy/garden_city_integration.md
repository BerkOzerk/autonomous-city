# Ebenezer Howard and Urban Autonomy

## 1. Introduction

Ebenezer Howard’s Garden City model is an early attempt to design a city that balances:

- self-sufficiency,
- human scale,
- social cohesion,
- ecological integration.

It anticipates several principles of contemporary autonomous urban systems.

## 2. Key Principles Relevant to Autonomy

### 2.1 Population Cap and Manageability

Howard proposed:

- limited population (~32,000),
- clearly defined urban boundary.

This supports:

- social legibility,
- manageable governance,
- resistance to uncontrolled sprawl.

---

### 2.2 Local Resource Cycles

Garden Cities integrate:

- housing,
- workplaces,
- services,
- agriculture,

into a coherent unit, enabling local production and shorter supply chains.

---

### 2.3 Permanent Greenbelt

The greenbelt:

- protects agricultural land,
- secures local food production,
- stabilizes ecological cycles,
- prevents urban expansion and speculation.

It acts as a **metabolic boundary**.

---

### 2.4 Federation of Towns

Howard’s model envisions:

- multiple small cities,
- connected but not absorbed into a single metropolis.

This anticipates a **polycentric, distributed urban system**, where each unit retains a degree of autonomy while cooperating regionally.

---

## 3. Relevance for Future Autonomous Cities

Garden City principles provide:

- a historical foundation for resource-based autonomy,
- population and scale guidance,
- a morphological model for ring-based, bounded urban growth,
- a federation logic compatible with distributed governance.

Howard’s work can be read as a proto-autonomous urban framework.
