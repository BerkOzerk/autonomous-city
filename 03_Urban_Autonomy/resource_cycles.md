# Local Resource Cycles

Autonomous cities seek to close key resource loops within their territory:

- **Water:** harvesting, recycling, infiltration,
- **Energy:** renewable generation and storage,
- **Food:** urban and peri-urban agriculture,
- **Materials:** reuse, repair, and circular flows,
- **Waste:** minimization, separation, and transformation.

## Why Local Cycles?

- reduce vulnerability to external shocks,
- foster resilience during crises,
- tie everyday life to ecological awareness,
- align autonomy with environmental responsibility.
