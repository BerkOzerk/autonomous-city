# Implementation Scenarios

## 1. Retrofitting Existing Cities

- identify districts suitable for autonomy pilots,
- introduce local governance structures,
- shift to neighborhood-level energy and resource systems,
- reprogram public space to support local life.

---

## 2. Building Autonomous Districts

- design new urban quarters with autonomy principles from the start,
- create strong links between built form, governance, and ecology,
- use them as laboratories for wider city transformation.

---

## 3. New Autonomous City Projects

- greenfield developments based entirely on autonomy logic,
- require careful attention to culture-building and not only infrastructure,
- must avoid becoming top-down technocratic experiments.

---

## 4. Regional Networks

- several autonomous cities or districts cooperating,
- shared ecological corridors and infrastructures,
- federation agreements for mobility, trade, and crisis support.

Autonomy is not isolation: it thrives in **networks of mutual support**.
