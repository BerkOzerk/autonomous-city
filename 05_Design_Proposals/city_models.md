# Autonomous City Models

## 1. Cellular Autonomous City

A city composed of multiple semi-autonomous districts:

- each with local governance,
- partial resource cycles,
- recognizable identity.

Cells coordinate through federated mechanisms rather than strict central control.

---

## 2. Network of Autonomous Villages

A distributed model with:

- small settlements,
- shared regional infrastructures,
- overlapping cultural and economic ties.

Autonomy is strong locally but reinforced through cooperation.

## 3. Ecological Ring City

A ring-shaped or bounded urban form with:

- compact urban core,
- surrounding ecological and agricultural landscapes,
- strong limitation on outward expansion.

The ring city uses its boundary as a **metabolic and political limit**, reinforcing autonomy by design.

## 4. Garden City Federation

A contemporary reinterpretation of Howard’s idea:

- multiple medium-sized cities (30–40K residents),
- each surrounded by protected greenbelts,
- connected via transportation and communication networks,
- collaborating yet retaining local autonomy.

This federation embodies **polycentric autonomy** at regional scale.
