# Autonomous Neighbourhood Models

## Concept

Neighborhoods function as:

- semi-autonomous units,
- with local governance,
- local resource handling,
- distinct identities.

---

## Components

- local energy microgrids,
- shared workspaces and workshops,
- mixed-use blocks with housing and small commerce,
- communal kitchens, gardens, and gathering spaces.

---

## Role in the City

Autonomous neighborhoods:

- reduce the load on central institutions,
- allow experimentation at small scale,
- increase overall robustness of the city.
