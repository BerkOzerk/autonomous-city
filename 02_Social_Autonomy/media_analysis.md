# Media and Control Mechanisms

Modern media and platform infrastructures:

- steer attention,
- filter information,
- reward certain behaviors,
- normalize specific values and lifestyles.

## Risks for Autonomy

- manufactured consent,
- echo chambers,
- invisible agenda setting,
- metrics replacing meaning (likes, views, followers).

## Toward Media Autonomy

An autonomous city should:

- support decentralized communication networks,
- promote media literacy,
- develop community-controlled media channels,
- ensure diversity of perspectives and formats.

Without media autonomy, political and urban autonomy remain incomplete.
