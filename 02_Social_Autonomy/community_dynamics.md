# Community Dynamics in Autonomous Systems

## Key Requirements
- open civic interaction,
- shared responsibilities,
- transparent processes,
- interdependence without hierarchy.

## Why Community?
Autonomy emerges through:
- collective rituals,
- collaboration,
- shared decision-making.

Without community cohesion, autonomy collapses.
