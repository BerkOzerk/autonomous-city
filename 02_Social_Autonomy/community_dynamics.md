# Community Dynamics in Autonomous Systems

## Why Community Matters

Autonomy is a **collective property**.  
It depends on:

- mutual trust,
- shared practices,
- common institutions,
- collaborative problem-solving.

## Key Requirements

- Open channels for discussion and disagreement.
- Shared responsibilities and rotating roles.
- Spaces for gatherings, rituals, and everyday encounters.
- Mechanisms to integrate newcomers without erasing identity.

---

## Fragility Points

Autonomy weakens when:

- communities are fragmented,
- participation becomes symbolic,
- real decisions move to hidden or expert-only arenas.

Sustained community life is a structural requirement for autonomy.
