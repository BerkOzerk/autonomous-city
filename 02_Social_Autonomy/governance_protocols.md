# Governance Protocols for an Autonomous City

## Principles

- **Distributed governance:** no single permanent decision center.
- **Recallable roles:** all responsibilities can be revoked or rotated.
- **Transparent procedures:** decisions, votes, and rationales are logged.
- **Participatory access:** residents can propose, deliberate, and vote.

- Allow for continuous adaptation and learning.

- periodic review of rules and protocols.
