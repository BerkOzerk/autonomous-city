# Cultural Resilience in Autonomous Communities

## Why Culture Matters

Autonomy is not only about infrastructure.  
It also depends on:

- shared meaning,
- narratives of belonging,
- collective memory,
- symbolic practices.

---

## Requirements

- locally grounded cultural production (art, festivals, rituals),
- spaces for expression and dissent,
- intergenerational transmission of stories and knowledge,
- resistance to homogenizing global trends.

---

## Cultural Vulnerabilities

- algorithm-driven content feeds,
- globalized aesthetic templates,
- commodified identities,
- loss of local languages, crafts, and practices.

Cultural resilience is the **immune system** of an autonomous society.
