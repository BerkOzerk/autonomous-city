# IoT Infrastructure in Autonomous Cities

## Role of Sensing

IoT devices can:

- monitor environmental conditions,
- track resource flows,
- detect failures and anomalies,
- inform collective decisions.

---

## Autonomy Requirements

IoT systems should be:

- privacy-preserving,
- locally governed,
- open to audit,
- resilient to outages and attacks.

Data collection must serve **collective autonomy**, not external surveillance or control.
