# Distributed Systems for Urban Autonomy

## Why Distribution?

Distributed systems:

- reduce single points of failure,
- dilute power concentration,
- increase resilience under stress,
- align with the logic of autonomy.

---

## Application Areas

- participatory budgeting and voting,
- localized energy grids,
- decentralized identity and access control,
- neighborhood-level data collection and analysis.

---

## Design Considerations

- latency vs. reliability,
- privacy vs. transparency,
- governance of updates and forks,
- inclusivity of non-technical participants.
