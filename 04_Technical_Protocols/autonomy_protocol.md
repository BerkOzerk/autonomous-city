# Autonomy Protocol: A Governance OS for Cities

## Purpose

The Autonomy Protocol is a conceptual operating system for:

- decision-making,
- resource allocation,
- role assignment,
- conflict resolution,

within an autonomous city.

---

## Key Features

- **Decentralized execution:** no single point of control.
- **Verifiable logs:** decisions and actions are recorded.
- **Rule-based processes:** proposals, votes, and implementations follow clear logic.
- **Adaptive updates:** rules can be revised through agreed procedures.

The protocol ensures that autonomy is sustained by **structure**, not by trust alone.
