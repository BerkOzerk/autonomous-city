# Data Transparency Protocols

## Why Transparency?

Transparency:

- exposes corruption risks,
- builds trust,
- enables informed participation,
- supports accountability.

## Tools

- public dashboards for key metrics,
- open data portals,
- verifiable logs of decisions and expenditures,
- simple visualization for non-experts.

Transparency is a **core safeguard** against the drift from autonomy toward hidden autocracy.
