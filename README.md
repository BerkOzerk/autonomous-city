# Autonomous Urban Systems – A Theoretical and Architectural Framework

## 1. Rationale
This repository investigates the concept of autonomy at individual, collective, urban, and technological scales. It asks:

**Is an autonomous city possible?**

Using philosophical foundations, architectural reasoning, and socio‑technological analysis, it proposes a theoretical model for autonomous urban systems.

This work aims to:
- Explain what autonomy is.
- Examine why autonomy matters today.
- Explore how autonomy could be achieved.
- Identify threats to autonomy (media, technology, consumption, autocracy).
- Define principles for autonomous spatial, social, and infrastructural design.

## 2. Repository Structure
The content is divided into modular folders for easy branching:

- **01_Theory** → Philosophy, autonomy, governance, threats  
- **02_Social_Autonomy** → Collective behavior, institutions, cultural mechanisms  
- **03_Urban_Autonomy** → Spatial systems, architecture, ecology  
- **04_Technical_Protocols** → Digital governance, decentralization, IoT  
- **05_Design_Proposals** → Applied models for autonomous cities

## 3. Core Thesis
Autonomy is not merely technical.  
It is **behavioral, cultural, spatial, and systemic**.

An autonomous city is possible, but only if cultural autonomy is achieved alongside technological and spatial independence.

## 4. How to Contribute
- Create branches for philosophical expansions, city models, or technical protocols.  
- Add proposals under `/05_Design_Proposals`.  
- Submit pull requests to refine conceptual models.
