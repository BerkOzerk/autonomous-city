Purpose of the Article and Contribution Model

## 1. Purpose of the Article

This article has been prepared to examine the concept of the autonomous city within a scientific framework, in relation to the ecological, social, cultural, and governance vulnerabilities faced by modern urban environments. The objectives of this study are:

    To define the concept of autonomy through an interdisciplinary approach,

    To examine the theoretical, spatial, ecological, and cultural requirements of autonomous cities,

    To bring together philosophical, sociological, architectural, and governance foundations,

    To analyze contemporary threats such as media, technology, consumption, and centralization,

    To develop principles and proposals for the design of autonomous cities,

    To provide a scientific framework that is participatory and capable of evolving over time.

This work does not aim to present a single, fixed model; rather, it represents an open‑ended research structure intended to develop through academic and practical contributions.

## 2. Living and Open Contribution Model

This article is designed as a living document. Over time, it is expected to evolve with:

    New research

    New theoretical frameworks

    Alternative city models

    Ecological analyses

    Governance protocols

    Field studies and case analyses

    Critiques and commentary

Each contribution may be recorded as a new version of the article (v1.01 → v1.02 → v1.1 …).
