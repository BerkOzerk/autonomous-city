# Autonomous Urban Systems – A Theoretical and Architectural Framework

## 1. Rationale

This repository investigates the concept of autonomy at individual, collective, urban, and technological scales. It asks:

> **Is an autonomous city possible?**

Using philosophical foundations, architectural reasoning, and socio‑technological analysis, it proposes a theoretical model for autonomous urban systems.

This work aims to:

- Explain what autonomy is.
- Examine why autonomy matters in modern society.
- Explore how autonomy could be achieved in practice.
- Identify threats to autonomy (media, technology, consumption, autocracy).
- Define principles for autonomous spatial, social, and infrastructural design.

## 2. Repository Structure

- **01_Theory** – Philosophy, autonomy, governance, threats  
- **02_Social_Autonomy** – Collective behavior, institutions, cultural mechanisms

## 3. Core Thesis

Autonomy is not merely a technical problem.  
It is **behavioral, cultural, spatial, and systemic**.

An autonomous city is possible, but only if cultural autonomy is achieved alongside technological and spatial independence.
